Art-Like

TODO:
Add Like buttons
Add UPDATE USER INFO page
Link USER with LIKE Document

UPDATE 10/25

Login and SignIn have been added from firebase. 

As I continue to develop my front end magic, I'm trying to figure out a way to make logins and likes work within this blog. There will be no post mechanism, but this is just for my own learning.

GOAL:
Eventually, I intend to optimize the logic within this app to attatch it to a larger art sharing app. Hopefully building it in such a way that it becomes scalable to instagram proportions.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
